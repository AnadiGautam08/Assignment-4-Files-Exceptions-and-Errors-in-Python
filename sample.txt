When all is on the line
you can see it in my eyes
you can see it in my eyes

When it feels like do or die
You know im gonna fight
You can bet im gonna fight


We’ve only got one chance to live
one chance to live

And It all comes down to this
It all comes down to this

This is the moment
And its time to rise – its time to rise

This is the moment
And I feel the fire
I feel the fire


Ill give all I got to give
This is the moment
And It all comes down to this

Sound the battlecry
You can hear it for miles
You can hear it for miles

Im callin out the liars
Cut em down to size
Prove Im still alive
